# Session 4 - [Jan 29th] - [How Web Works] 

 ## What I learned today 
- DNS = domain name system 
- i would type in a website (babson.edu for an example) and dns would translate it into an IP address (babson.edu would be 166.117.19.175)
- HTTP = hyper text transfer protocol
- the browser would then send a request to the server (GET)
- GET = retrieve data 
- POST = send data 
- status codes:
    - 200 = OK
    - 404 = not found 
    - 500 = server error
- demo is what the browser downloads 

 ## Challenges I faced 
- I honestly understood what we spoke about in class and do not have any questions regarding what we talked about in class today

 ## AI usage 
- n/a 

 ## Questions for next time 
 - How can I make my personal website better?
