# Session 6 - [HTML essentials]

<h4 class="date"><em>Date: Feb 5th, 2026</em></h4>

 ## What I learned today 
- on the navigation bar, onc eyou open 'inspect', you can easily change the style of your website under the "display: flex" button. you are able to see the different formats for your webiste firsthand. 
- the changes you make in inspect, are NOT permanent because you are only changing the downloaded file, so when you refresh, it goes back to original format
- if you put ```, you are able to write code and not have VS code take it is a coding example, so when i have questions in the future, i can show the line of code i am reffering to
- <> are called tasks 
- when you type "html:5" it gives you the standard skeleton for html and then you can add/continue the code


 ## Challenges I faced 
-  

 ## AI usage (if any)
- i asked how to make the date smaller text size, italized, and a subheader

 ## Questions for next time
