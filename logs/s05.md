# Session 5 - [HTML Essentials] 

<h4 class="date"><em>Date: Feb 3rd, 2026</em></h4>


 ## What I learned today 
- A URL is easier to remember and dns translates it into an IP address
- when you view a webpage, my browser downloads HTML files 
- GET is when i ask my server to show me information 
- POST is when i ask my server anything 
- i would use "inspect" to visit website codes and learn from other websites too 

Anatomy of a URL 
- babson.edu is the domain ONLY (so it goes to the default page)
- babson.edu/about goes to about page 
- babson.edu/about/ is a folder (which usually shows index)

- IP V6 was created to have more IP addresses
- IP V4 is not enough for the amount of devices in the world
 ## Challenges I faced 
- Asking chatgpt to write code for me, I do not know what to ask it exactly

 ## AI usage 
- I asked AI to make my personal website better and this was the prompt
now do it for my personal website but not as complex. i just need to have an about me section and other simple things you think should be included in my personal website. this is what i have so far:Hello world!! <!doctype html> <html lang="en"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" /> <title>My Page</title> </head> <body> <h1>Title</h1> <p>Hi! My name is Sophia Milian.</p> </html>

 ## Questions for next time 
 - what is the correct termonology to ask chatgpt when making my personal website better and writing code in general?
 - if i do not have any specific pictures or videos for my website that i personally have but i want to include some, how can i ask chatgpt to do that with pictures from google?
