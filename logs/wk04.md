# Week 4 - [HTML & CSS Essentials ]

<h4 class="date"><em>Date: Feb 10th, 2026 & Feb 12th , 2026</em></h4>

 ## What I learned this week 
- why an image doesnt have an end tag --> because an image should not include any text inside so that is why it does not have the tags on each side
- SVG: means you can use code to draw shapes
- SPAN: it is for inline texts (highlighting a part of an element; it tages the specific element out where you can use different styles to differentiate it)
- ctrl & i means you are wanting to change a specific part of the code and it could generate more code for you 
- inline suggestions are not very reliable because their code is outdated

- important HTML vocab:
doctype, element, tag, tag name, start tag, end tag, attribute name/value, comment, text, character reference, root, parent/child/children, dummy, etc...
- attribute name is what is on the lefthand side of the equal sign while attribute is the whole name + value (it consist of the whole thing)
- html/css important syntax (shows you what everything means by highlighting term in code): https://curio-team.github.io/vocabs/?name=html&lang=en#parent 
- CSS essentials:
    - it controls how html elements look: colors, fonts, spacing, layout, etc...
    - without css, websites would just be plain 
- learning how to add css to my about me file and other files in general (i added to s08 by changing the font size & color)




 ## Challenges I faced 
-  uploading an image to my code and having it in the correct format
-  improving my about-me.html file to how i would like for it to look; i had to ask chat to redo and improve many sections by asking it many many questions
- correctly uploading an image to my file so it shows online; i can show the link correctly but not where the photo is already displayed 
- removing the internal css codes within the about-me page




 ## AI usage (if any)
- asked to add more tags and sematics to my s07-demo page
- adding more content to my about-me section, i asked what else does ai suggest to add to an about me page, i improved with semantic html and added a new page called 'my favorites' using ai
- asked chat to make my about-me section prettier to look at and not have everything in black and white

- asked chat how to open my index.html live and it said i can input this: "python -m http.server 8000" and i can open it live instead of using live server if i wanted to
- i asked for it change my picture from a cat to a lion
- asked to add a color scheme using pastel blues and purples add spacing between my sections in my about-me.html
- asked to had a hamburger to open on the right-side menu with all the sections so the page is not full of words






 ## Questions for next time 
- Why can i preview my session logs but not my session demos?
