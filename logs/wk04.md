# Week 4 - [...]

<h4 class="date"><em>Date: Feb 10th, 2026 & Feb 12th , 2026</em></h4>

 ## What I learned this week 
- why an image doesnt have an end tag --> because an image should not include any text inside so that is why it does not have the tags on each side
- SVG: means you can use code to draw shapes
- SPAN: it is for inline texts (highlighting a part of an element; it tages the specific element out where you can use different styles to differentiate it)
- ctrl & i means you are wanting to change a specific part of the code and it could generate more code for you 
- inline suggestions are not very reliable because their code is outdated


 ## Challenges I faced 
-  uploading an image to my code and having it in the correct format
-  improving my about-me.html file to how i would like for it to look; i had to ask chat to redo and improve many sections by asking it many many questions

 ## AI usage (if any)
- asked to add more tags and sematics to my s07-demo page
- adding more content to my about-me section, i asked what else does ai suggest to add to an about me page, i improved with semantic html and added a new page called 'my favorites' using ai
- asked chat to make my about-me section prettier to look at and not have everything in black and white

 ## Questions for next time 
- Why can i preview my session logs but not my session demos?
